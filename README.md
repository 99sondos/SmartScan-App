# SmartScan App

## 📌 Overview
SmartScan is a mobile application developed as part of a **Mobile Application Development** course project in collaboration with **Capgemini**.

The project was built by a student team within a five-week timeframe and focuses on delivering a functional mobile solution with backend integration.

---

## 🎯 Goal
The goal of the project was to design and implement a mobile application that includes:
- A clear user flow and mobile UI
- Data handling and storage
- Backend integration for real-world functionality

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack
- **Android** (Kotlin / Android Studio)
- **Firebase** (Firestore, authentication, security rules)
- Gradle build system

---

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `app/` – Android application source code  
- `gradle/`, `build.gradle.kts` – build configuration  
- Firebase configuration and rules files (Firestore rules & indexes)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Open in **Android Studio**
3. Add required Firebase configuration (if applicable)
4. Build and run the app on an emulator or Android device

---

## 🤖 AI-Based Features
The application integrates AI-based functionalities through external APIs to enhance the user experience.

Within the limited project timeframe, the team implemented:
- **Face scanning** functionality using an external AI service
- **Barcode scanning** for structured data capture
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** for extracting text from images

These features were integrated using available APIs, focusing on practical usage and system integration rather than developing custom AI models.


## 👥 Team Project
This project was developed collaboratively by a student team (Mobile Application course).
